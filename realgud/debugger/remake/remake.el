String COMMAND-LINE specifies how to run remake.

Normally command buffers are reused when the same debugger is
reinvoked inside a command buffer with a similar command. If we
discover that the buffer has prior command-buffer information and
NO-RESET is nil, then that information which may point into other
buffers and source buffers which may contain marks and fringe or
marginal icons is reset."

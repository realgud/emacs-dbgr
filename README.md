A modular GNU Emacs front-end for interacting with external debuggers.

See https://github.com/rocky/emacs-dbgr/wiki/Debuggers-Supported for a list of debuggers supported.

The debugger is run out of a *comint* process buffer, or you can use a
`M-x track-mode` inside an existing shell.

To install you'll need a couple of other Emacs packages installed. See
[the installation instructions](http://wiki.github.com/rocky/emacs-dbgr/how-to-install)
for details.

To get started using see the
[notes on using emacs-dbgr](http://wiki.github.com/rocky/emacs-dbgr/how-to-use)
.
